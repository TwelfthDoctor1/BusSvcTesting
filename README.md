# Singapore Bus Stop Arrival Timing (Testing)

The code in this repository makes use of Land Transport Authority's (LTA) DataMall Dynamic API to call the bus arrival times for a specified bus stop.

To make calls with the DataMall API, you will need to sign up to use the service.

For this version of the code, it is intended to be used on devices such as:

* Raspberry Pi (the Pico version does not apply here)
* Devices that can run Python (Mainly computers)

The MicroPython version will be released onto a separate branch at a later date.
